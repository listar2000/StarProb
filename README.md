# StarProb
### Handy Python Package for Probabilistic Computations
StarProb tries to figure out a easy way to create, manipulate, and calculate different probabilistic random variables, including both discrete and continuous ones. The aim is to have a progressive framework: enabling operations from basic statistical simulations (such as repetitive coin toss) to more complicated transformations/convolutions.

This project is inspired by two courses at `UC Berkeley`: Introduction to Statistics and Probability `Stat 20` and Concepts of Probability `Stat 134`. My hope to reinforce textbook knowledge through writing codes motivate me to spend my spare time developing this package.

## File Structure
- `README.md` this file, introduction to the pacakge.
- `commit_msg.md` specifies basic rules and categories of the commit messages (which is important to make the repo clean).
